# Matrix-calculator

## About
This is a matrix calculator with console menu which performs 8 operations with matriсes filled with double numbers: addition, subtracting, multiplication of two matriсes and matrix by a number, transposition, search of determinant of a square matrix and inverse square matrix, solving sle.

## Functionality

Immediately after starting the calculator a console menu with 8 items responsible for operations on matrices appears. Ninth option in the menu is exit. User selects the necessary operation and enters the number of rows and columns with the prompts of the system and then the matrix. If the values are entered incorrectly, the operation will be stopped with message of error and the user will have to do everything again.

1. _Addition of two matrices_ 
This operation is available for matrices of the same size. If they are not, system will show message "Error. Try again".

2. _Subtracting of two matrices_
This operation is available for matrices of the same size. If they are not, system will show message "Error. Try again".

3. _Multiplication of two matrices_
This operation is available for matrices if amount of columns of the first one is equal to amount of rows of the second one. If they are not, system will show message "Error. Try again".

4. _Multiplying a matrix by a number_
This operation is available for any matrix.

5. _Matrix transposition_
This operation is available for any matrix.

6. _Determinant of a square matrix_
This operation is available only for square matrices. If they are not, system will show message "Error. Try again".

7. _Inverse square matrix_
This operation is available only for square matrices. If they are not, system will show message "Error. Try again". Also if determinant of matrix is 0, there will be shown message "There is no inverse matrix for the entered one".

8. _System of linear equation_
This operation is available only for square matrices. If they are not, system will show message "Error. Try again".
